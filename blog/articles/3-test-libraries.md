# 2 Java unit test libraries
A unit test need to be simple and test just one scenario in isolated way.
There are two Java libraries that help to do that:

* Junit
* EasyMock

The first one is a platform that help a java developer to create tests and run in a JVM. The second is a library that
help you to isolate the test creating mocks to you.

## Mock

In a unit test, the main goal is to test some behavior from one unit (a class in Java).

## Project Example

The best way to learn is practising. So, let define some project to examplefy the use of test. Therefore, we have a
project to need to test a class called `GenerateCertificate` that has a constructor with a argument of
type `ExportService` witch is an interface that has two implementations: `JsonExportService` and `PDFExportService`.
