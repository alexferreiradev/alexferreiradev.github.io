# 2 Java unit test libraries
A unit test need to be simple and test just one scenario in isolated way.
There are two Java libraries that help to do that:
* Junit
* EasyMock

The first one is a platform that help a java developer to create tests and run in a JVM. The second is a library that help you to isolate the test creating mocks to you.

## Mock
In a unit test, the main goal is to test some behavior from one unit (a class in Java).

## Project Example

## Junit
